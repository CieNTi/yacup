## Introduction

A clean and handy way to deal with your documentation is to exploit the [**GitHub Pages**](https://pages.github.com/), which represents a nice tool to publish software documentation online.

Everything is basically done through the special branch called **`gh-pages`**. The branch must contain at the root level the **index.html** file pointing to the static documentation (generally generated via [**doxygen**](http://www.doxygen.org)) stored somewhere within the branch itself. Further, the static documentation might be composed of many products (sometimes images), thus it would be worth saving space on the repository by not retaining any history for those files.

First off, we explain how to **create the infrastructure** for the documentation using _git_ and keep it **up-to-date** throughout the changes the code undergoes. Then, we will dig into how we can use **doxygen** to generate the documentation.

Let's start :sparkles:

### Creating the infrastructure
In your git project folder create a new **empty** branch called `gh-pages` on your repository.

```
cd your-project-folder
git checkout --orphan gh-pages
```

If your project is not a newly created project you probably already have tracked files.
The following command will clean the working area.

```
git rm -rf .
```

Now create the *permanent* files (the ones which will not be overwritten by the automatic documentation procedure). Usually this means a `.gitignore` file, possibly different from the one in the `master` branch of your project, and the `index.html` file which will point to the documentation.
If your doxygen configuration generates the *html* docs in `html` folder, the following `index.html` should be ok.

```html
<!DOCTYPE HTML>
<html lang="en-US">
    <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8">
        <meta http-equiv="refresh" content="1;url=html/index.html">
        <title>Page Redirection</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        If you are not redirected automatically, follow the <a href="html/index.html">link to the documentation</a>
    </body>
</html>
```

Now you can commit and push to the `gh-pages` branch
```
git add .gitignore index.html
git commit -m "initial commit"
git push origin gh-pages
```

Now we have to configure **Travis-CI** to automatically generate the documentation and push to the `gh-pages` branch at every commit. This can be done by modifying the `.travis.yml` file.
Open your `travis.yml` file, and in the `after_success` block add the following code

```yaml
[...]
after_success:
  # Generate the docs only if master, the travis_build_docs is true and we can use secure variables
  - >-
    if [[ "$TRAVIS_BRANCH" = "master" && -n "$TRAVIS_BUILD_DOCS" && "$TRAVIS_PULL_REQUEST" = "false" ]] ; then
      cd $PROJECT_DIR_ABS
      source .ci/setup-ssh.sh || travis_terminate 1
      .ci/generateDocumentation.sh || travis_terminate 1
    fi
```

Note that the `if` statement checks three conditions:
- the branch must be `master` (for now multiple versions docs are not supported)
- the user-defined variable `TRAVIS_BUILD_DOCS` must be defined. This is used to use only one travis job to build the documentation in case a build matrix is present
- builds on pull requests are disabled. Only normal commits on `master` are used. Note that once a PR is accepted, it always generates a commit on the destination branch

In the previous lines two additional scripts located in the `.ci` folder are called.
One, `.ci/setup-ssh.sh` is needed to manage authentication in Travis (as Travis needs to push on the repository the generated documentation). We discuss how to setup SSH for Travis in [Setup SSH use for Travis](#setup-ssh-use-for-travis).
The second script, `.ci/generateDocumentation.sh` is the script which actually calls doxygen. See [Generate the documentation](#generate-the-documentation) for details on the script.

### Setup SSH use for Travis

There are multiple options to give Travis push permissions on the repository. We chose to use the GitHub deploy keys as they are not tied to a particular user but only to a single repository.

To add a new deploy key to your repository follow these [instructions](https://developer.github.com/guides/managing-deploy-keys/#deploy-keys).
Once we added the new key, we have to encrypt (to increase the security) and to give to Travis the private key.
The easiest way it to use the Travis Command line tools and follow [this guide](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/encrypting-files). 
Follow the printed instructions. The command line utility should have already updated your repository settings in Travis, by adding the encrypted variables. You have to add to the repository **only** the encrypted private key.

The script to load the ssh key in travis is the following

```sh
#!/bin/bash
# setup-ssh.sh: load the SSH key 

set -ev
declare -r SSH_FILE="$(mktemp -u $HOME/.ssh/travis_temp_ssh_key_XXXX)"
# Decrypt the file containing the private key (put the real name of the variables)
openssl aes-256-cbc \
  -K $encrypted_XXXXXXXXXX_key \
  -iv $encrypted_XXXXXXXXXX_iv \
  -in ".ci/travis_deploy_key.enc" \
  -out "$SSH_FILE" -d
# Enable SSH authentication
chmod 600 "$SSH_FILE" \
  && printf "%s\n" \
       "Host github.com" \
       "  IdentityFile $SSH_FILE" \
       "  LogLevel ERROR" >> ~/.ssh/config
```

### Generate the documentation
The last step is to write the script to actually generate the documentation.
This is the full script:

```sh
#!/bin/sh
################################################################################
# Title         : generateDocumentation.sh
# Date created  : 2017
# Notes         : original script from Jeroen de Bruijn
__AUTHOR__="Francesco Romano"
# Preconditions:
# - Packages doxygen doxygen-doc doxygen-gui graphviz
#   must be installed.
# - Doxygen configuration file must have the destination directory empty and
#   source code directory with a $(TRAVIS_BUILD_DIR) prefix.
# - An gh-pages branch should already exist. See below for mor info on hoe to
#   create a gh-pages branch.
#
# Required global variables:
# - TRAVIS_BUILD_NUMBER : The number of the current build.
# - TRAVIS_COMMIT       : The commit that the current build is testing.
# - DOXYFILE            : The Doxygen configuration file.
# - GH_REPO_NAME        : The name of the repository.
# - GH_REPO_REF         : The GitHub reference to the repository.
# - GH_REPO_TOKEN       : Secure token to the github repository.
#

# https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/environment-variables/#Encrypted-Variables
# or https://gist.github.com/vidavidorra/7ed6166a46c537d3cbd2
# For information on how to create a clean gh-pages branch from the master

#
# This script will generate Doxygen documentation and push the documentation to
# the gh-pages branch of a repository specified by GH_REPO_REF.
# Before this script is used there should already be a gh-pages branch in the
# repository.

    echo 'Uploading documentation to the gh-pages branch...'
    # Add everything in this directory (the Doxygen code documentation) to the

    # Commit the added files with a title and description containing the Travis CI
    # build number and the GitHub commit reference that issued this build.
    git commit -m "Deploy code docs to GitHub Pages Travis build: ${TRAVIS_BUILD_NUMBER}" -m "Commit: ${TRAVIS_COMMIT}"

    # Force push to the remote gh-pages branch.
    # The ouput is redirected to /dev/null to hide any sensitive credential data
    # that might otherwise be exposed.

```

Note that in the above script there are some assumptions:
- the main `.dox` file is defined by the `DOXYFILE` variable.
- If you use a Doxygen Layout file, we copy it in the current directory:
```sh
cp $TRAVIS_BUILD_DIR/doc/DoxygenLayout.xml .
```
This is because it seems that the DoxygenLayout file path is taken with respect to where the `doxygen` command is executed.
- To keep the repository clean we remove all the commits but the first one. Note that in order to keep the script simple at least one commit should exist (and it does if you followed this guide)
